* ci: add commitlint for Conventional Commits
* ci: integrate CodeClimate for coding standards and code quality
* ci: configure all checks (Biome, Vitest, Playwright, commitlint, CodeClimate) in CI pipeline
* docs: document development workflow and code quality standards

### Design System & Layout

## 📅 Next Steps

The next milestone is focused on tooling and code quality:
