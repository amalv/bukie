This PR provides a comprehensive analysis of the current Bukie project state and recommends the next feature to implement based on the existing roadmap and technical architecture.

## Current State Assessment

After exploring the live website at https://bukie.vercel.app/ and analyzing the codebase, Bukie has evolved into a sophisticated book discovery platform with impressive technical maturity:

The project successfully implements:
- Modern, responsive book discovery platform with clean UI design
- Comprehensive search functionality across books, authors, and genres  
- Homepage sections (All Books, New Arrivals, Top Rated, Trending Now)
- Rich book cards displaying ratings, reviews, descriptions, and cover images
- Individual book detail pages with full metadata
- Dark/light mode theming (SSR-safe, no FOUC)
- Full-stack database integration (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- Complete REST API layer with CRUD operations
- Pagination and filtering capabilities
- Comprehensive testing strategy (Vitest, Playwright, Storybook)
- Production deployment on Vercel with Neon PostgreSQL

## Recommended Next Feature: Personal Library with Reading Status Tracking

Based on the current architecture and roadmap analysis, I recommend implementing a **Personal Library system with Reading Status Tracking** as the next major feature. This would transform Bukie from a discovery tool into a personal reading companion.

### Why This Feature Makes Strategic Sense

1. **Natural Progression** - Builds organically on the existing book discovery features
2. **User Engagement** - Creates stickiness and provides tangible personal value  
3. **Foundation Builder** - Enables future features like recommendations, social sharing, and reviews
4. **Technical Alignment** - Leverages existing book schema, API patterns, and component architecture
5. **Roadmap Consistency** - Authentication (Clerk) is already planned as the next milestone

### Core Implementation Components

The feature would include:
- **User Authentication Integration** using Clerk (already decided in ADR)
- **Personal Library Data Model** with user accounts and reading status tracking
- **Reading Status Workflow** (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished)
- **Enhanced UI Components** including user dashboard and library management
- **Extended API Layer** for user-specific book operations and statistics

This recommendation aligns with the project's incremental milestone approach while providing immediate user value and establishing the foundation for advanced community and recommendation features.
