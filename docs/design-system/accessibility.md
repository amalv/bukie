# Accessibility in Bukie

Accessibility is a core requirement. All primitives and components must:

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide labels, roles, and focus management
- Support keyboard navigation and focus traps
- Avoid encoding meaning in color alone
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

## Best Practices
- Use `aria-*` attributes where needed
- Ensure visible focus states
- Document accessibility features in stories and docs
