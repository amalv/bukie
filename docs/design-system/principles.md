# Design System Principles

Bukieâ€™s design system is inspired by Material Design 3 and emphasizes:

- **Consistency:** Use tokens and primitives for predictable, scalable UI
- **Accessibility:** All components must be usable by keyboard, screen reader, and meet WCAG standards
- **Composability:** Prefer small, pure functions and components; avoid monoliths
- **SSR-first:** All critical UI is server-rendered for SEO and performance
- **Theming:** Semantic roles and tokens enable easy customization

## Usage Guidelines
- Use primitives (Grid, Button, etc.) as building blocks
- Apply tokens for spacing, color, and typography
- Document customizations and extensions
