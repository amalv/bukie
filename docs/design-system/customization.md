# Customization & Migration

Bukie is designed for easy extension and migration:

## Customization
- Extend tokens by updating the theme contract
- Add new primitives or override styles via Vanilla Extract
- Use Storybook to preview and test custom themes/components

## Migration
- Follow usage guidelines for replacing legacy styles/components
- Document migration steps in the design system docs
- Keep accessibility and SSR requirements in mind
