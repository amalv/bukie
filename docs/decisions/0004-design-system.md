# 🎨 Design System Decision
- Status: accepted

## 📚 Context
Bukie needs a flexible, maintainable design system that can evolve with the project and potentially be published as a standalone package in the future.

## 🎯 Decision Drivers
- Full control over styles and components
- Flexibility for custom branding and features
- Maintainability and scalability
- Potential for future reuse as an npm package

## 🔍 Considered Options
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- MUI (Material UI)
- Custom design system (in-project, later as npm package)

## ✅ Decision Outcome
A custom design system will be developed inside the project. It may be refactored into a standalone npm package in the future.

### 💡 Rationale
- Provides maximum flexibility and control over styles, components, and branding.
- Avoids the complexity and constraints of large frameworks and libraries.
- Enables incremental development and adaptation as project needs change.
- Keeps the codebase lean and maintainable.

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons
### Custom Design System
**👍 Pros:**
- Full control over design and implementation
- Easy to adapt and extend
- No external dependencies or constraints
**👎 Cons:**
- Requires more initial effort
- Must maintain and document components yourself

### Tailwind / shadcn/ui / MUI
**👍 Pros:**
- Fast prototyping
- Large community and resources
- Ready-made components
**👎 Cons:**
- Less control over design
- Can be harder to customize deeply
- May add unnecessary complexity or bloat

## 📋 Consequences
- Bukie will have a unique, fully controlled design system
- Future migration to an npm package is possible
- Initial development will require more effort, but long-term flexibility is maximized
